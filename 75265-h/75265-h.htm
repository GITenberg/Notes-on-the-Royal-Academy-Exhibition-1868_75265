<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> reader of this pamphlet will be apt to understand, from its very
arrangement, the fact that each of the writers speaks solely for
himself. Each chooses his own point of view, and expresses his own
opinion, and in his own way. If the opinions happen to diverge, it will
be for the reader to select, as he pleases, either or neither.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">A person</span> who undertakes to express to the public his opinion of any
such Exhibition as that of the Royal Academy is not unreasonably liable
to the imputation of presumption. For that imputation I am prepared; I
admit it to be, within certain limits, just; and must bear it as I may.</p>

<p>But there are two forms of possible and probable censure which I should
respectfully decline to accept as well bestowed.</p>

<p>The first is censure of a signed critical pamphlet, <em>rather than</em>
an unsigned newspaper or review article. The pamphlet expresses the
opinion of an individual: the article does or ought to do the same. So
far they stand on the same ground; anything which may be presumption
in the first is presumption in the second also. The difference is that
the first does, while the second does not, lay bare the writer to the
retorts of any person who may hold himself aggrieved: that may be more
open, more equitable, and more bold, but it is not more presumptuous.</p>

<p>The second form of misleading censure is that which makes a point of
reprobating omissions. The limits of this pamphlet, as to dimensions
and as to the time and facilities available for its preparation and
composition, are manifestly narrow. All that the writer professes is to
say straightforwardly whatever he does say: he by no means implies that
nothing else remains to be noted concerning the works of art commented
upon, nor that the works wholly omitted are undeserving of mention.
If anybody, therefore, tells me that the picture of A, of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>iv</span> this
pamphlet says nothing, merits criticism, or that the picture of B,
praised for colour, claims praise on the score of drawing also, I shall
have no difficulty in admitting the probable correctness of these
remarks; but, if he adds that I am blameable for the omissions, I shall
feel entitled to reply that A’s picture and B’s draughtsmanship were
not in the bond. What <em>is</em> in the bond is liberty of selection
and candour of statement on my part: if my selection is stupid, or my
statement unfair or erroneous, be that the charge. Let the censure
concern itself with something wrong that <em>is</em> done; not with
something right that might have been done.</p>

<hr class="short">

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Some</span> twenty years and more ago, the ingrained fault of the British
School of Painting was that it painted flimsy pictures. They were not
exactly sketchy, having little of either the merits or defects proper
to the phase of art termed sketching: pictures they were, but flimsy
pictures. Then came the thick-and-thin revolution of Præraphaelitism;
which aimed at treating substantial subjects, thinking them out deeply,
and painting them with abnormal thoroughness. That revolution scarcely
exists now otherwise than in its results: certain works executed
according to the principle in question, and representing it; many
others parodying or maiming the principle, and traducing it; a vast
number of works, still in course of active production, which owe their
genesis to the principle, but have metamorphosed it beyond recognition.
So that now we have come round to a condition of the school more
analogous to that of twenty years ago: only that the present staple
product is, instead of flimsy pictures, works executed with a valuable
reserve-fund of knowledge, efficiency, and material, but in the feeling
and with the aim proper to sketches. Critics have long been beseeching
for “breadth.” That is now supplied to them in handsome measure; but
it is found that breadth, like frittering, may overlie a considerable
surface of commonplace and inanity. The very skill of our current
generation of painters is one of their chief perils; for it enables
them to indicate with ease, and often indeed with mastery, what less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>2</span>
dexterity could only strive for with labour. Rapid gains and the tumult
of competition conduce towards the same result. The upshot, to some
critics, is, in the present Academy exhibition, a sense of no little
dissatisfaction, mingled with unstinted recognition of telling and
well-diffused ability. One perceives that many artists can now do a
good deal, if they choose; but the more sound one sees the attainments
of the painter himself to be, the less one is disposed to accept with
implicit faith the rather cheap outcome of those attainments. Sketches
may be excellent things, and they testify to the ready availability of
the artist’s gifts: but sketches magnified into pictures cloy upon one.
They betray in especial a self-complacent unconcern for higher efforts.
In general character the present Academy exhibition, the hundredth of
the series, is very like that of 1867: that was a particularly clever
display, according to its own standard, and this perhaps is nearly on a
par with
it.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[A]</a> To estimate the comparative merits of successive
Exhibitions is always to me a difficult matter. The sentence in the
text expresses what I felt about the present Academy show while I was
in the rooms and as I began writing; but, on treating of the pictures
individually, I so often have to say that some painter is this year
quite at his best that I infer the display of 1868 may probably be
fully as good as that of 1867. I leave the text, however, unaltered, as
faithful to a general impression.</p>
</div>

<p>With these few remarks, I turn at once to the walls, and begin with—</p>


<p>6. <span class="smcap">Millais</span>—<em>Sisters.</em>—It is a great satisfaction to
find Mr. Millais in force this year—in very superior force, for
instance, to what he displayed last year. This group of three girlish
sisters—the painter’s daughters—shows him in pure, unforced,
untrammelled possession of his mastery throughout. The arrangement of
the group is so far artificial that one clearly perceives the sisters
are posing for their portraits: no effort is made to disguise this
fact, and it cannot, I think, be counted as a blemish—rather as one
legitimate method of portrait-painting, though not so popular now as
the contrary scheme. All the three girls are dressed in white muslin,
with azure ribbons, and hair combed out. The background is composed
of azaleas, which, in the
left-hand<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
corner of the picture, seem to
change from crimson-pink to vermilion-pink; but the latter colour is
scrubbed about with no appreciable traces of form.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[B]</a> “Left-hand” and “right-hand,” in this pamphlet, will
always be used to designate the portions of the pictures opposite to
the <em>spectator’s</em> left and right respectively.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>3</span></p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap">Leys</span>—<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Famille Pallavicini de Gênes réclamant le
droit de Bourgeoisie des Bourgmestres et Echevins de la Ville d’Anvers,
1542.</em>—When our Royal Academy is honoured by a contribution from
one of the first magnates of European art, it becomes us to accept his
work in a spirit of gratitude, with much desire to study, and very
little to cavil. It is by way of study that I venture to note some
of the leading characteristics of that mediæval style which has made
Baron Leys famous throughout the civilized world. 1st. He identifies
himself with the period he paints—not only in a general way, as a
good scholar might do, but especially in respect of its concerted
outer demonstrations, and its social aspects, and this with all the
more zest when a spice of patriotism is involved. 2nd. Working from
this solid basis of mediævalism, he is never afraid of individualizing
his personages to the very uttermost: they are actual men and women
whom he might—and for anything I know does—pick up in the streets of
modern Belgium. An extreme instance appears in the present picture,
in the furthest right-hand figure, whose portrait-like aspect is
unmistakeable. This, however, being an obviously modern head, differs
from the generality—which, with their personal actuality, are somehow
<em>projected back</em>, by the imagination and skill of the painter,
into the mediæval period, and thus come to be even more like what
one conceives of the sixteenth than what one knows of the nineteenth
century. Hence an air of startling realism: the personages are as real
as if they were painted in coats and trowsers; and the mediævalism
is as real as any modern man can make it. The very uncouthness and
hard-featuredness of the figures is a powerful element in this realism:
it looks as if the painter had seen them actually there, and depicted
them as in duty bound—had he been selecting, one would expect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>4</span> more
of positive beauty or semi-idealism. 3rd. Baron Leys paints with a
remarkable mixture of force and slightness, detail and unfinish. He
gives an extraordinary number of items, and with singular strength of
definition, yet with little that can, on close inspection, be called
elaboration. Everything is done so as to solicit the eye at a little
distance, and up to a certain point to satisfy, never to satiate it.
The style of execution has even a good deal that might be termed rough
and ready; and (what is of great importance) it is quite unlike any
handiwork of the Middle Ages themselves. Moreover, the painter (in the
present phase of his style) very seldom gives any mere <em>accidents</em>
of light and shade—direct or flickering sunshine, contrasts of natural
and artificial light, or the like. It may seem fanciful to say that
this also subserves the historical impression; and yet I think it
does so powerfully—the scenes and the actors in them tell upon the
mind, through the eye, as having passed out of the momentary into the
permanent—out of the region of chance and change into that dim lumour
and remote subsistency of the past. Having said thus much, by way of
study, of Baron Leys’s pictures in general, I shall not endeavour
to analyse the particular work before us. It is a <em>replica</em> of
one of his frescoes in the Townhall of Antwerp, and illustrates the
value which distinguished foreigners were wont to set upon the right
of citizenship in that great commercial and privileged city. It is
to be regarded as an important and excellent specimen of the master,
though some others might deserve the preference in point of executive
completeness.</p>

<p>17. <span class="smcap">Linnell, Sen.</span>—<em>English Woodlands.</em>—A very
characteristic and fine example of the painter’s style: one might use
it as a text-book wherefrom to develope his specialties in the English
school of landscape.</p>


<p>30. <span class="smcap">Watts</span>—<em>Landscape, Evening.</em>—A small work, but
conspicuous by its broad, strong colour, very warm and mellow: it has
power both of hand and of sentiment. The sky is especially luminous.</p>


<p>44. <span class="smcap">Hemy</span>—<em>Tête de Flandre, near Antwerp.</em>—There is
a great deal of space in this picture: and the tone of green-grey
colour is finely felt and solidly sustained. A sense of the ripple in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>5</span>
the estuary is given by a curious sort of sleight of hand—an actual
ridging or rucking in the surface of the paint.</p>


<p>52. <span class="smcap">Cope</span>—<em>The Life’s Story.</em>—This is the subject of
Othello relating his adventures to Brabantio and Desdemona. The lady
hangs upon the words of the Moor with a demonstrative interest that
fully justified his inference that she must be in love with him. The
picture cannot, I think, be counted among Mr. Cope’s successes.</p>


<p>64. <span class="smcap">Grant</span>—<em>The Duke of Cambridge at the Battle of
the Alma, leading the Guards up the Hill in support of the Light
Division.</em>—The weak point of this picture is the isolated figure
of the Duke himself, which has more the character of a likeness by
a portrait-painter than of a leading agent in the event. The Guards
in the foreground are happily treated; with sufficient individuality
in the several figures, not made singly over-prominent. The general
execution is not unlike that of Sir Edwin Landseer; which is as much as
to say that it has uncommon ability.</p>


<p>70. <span class="smcap">Millais</span>—<em>Rosalind and Celia.</em>—A picture full of
sunny light and masterly celerity of execution. The faces have great
sentiment, and ample charm of beauty: the confiding self-subordinating
character of Celia speaks in the lines of her mouth. Touchstone is
older than one would infer from the drama. It is a pity that Mr.
Millais did not set himself to reflect what Rosalind would probably
have done with her hair and costume in order to sustain the disguise
of a young man. The upper portion of the dress is absurdly feminine,
and hardly recedes even from the nineteenth century. On the stage one
pardons the paraded sex of the actress—it is partly unavoidable, and
partly a device of her profession: but in a picture one fairly expects
a greater conformity to the common sense of the situation. Mr. Millais,
however, never <em>will</em> pay any attention to his costume. With
all the signal merits of the execution, the texture is not free from
woolliness.</p>


<p>87. <span class="smcap">Frith</span>—<em>Before dinner at Boswell’s Lodgings in Bond
Street, 1769: present, Johnson, Garrick, Goldsmith, Reynolds, Murphy,
Bickerstaff, Davies, and Boswell.</em>—We have heard only too often
about Goldsmith’s “bloom-coloured coat.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>6</span> This is the scene of its
exhibition before Boswell’s guests. The picture may be termed a
self-respecting one: the humours of the personages and the incident are
indicated without being made to stare one out of countenance. <em>Per
contra</em>, it must be said that strength is deficient throughout:
common weakish mouths prevail in this distinguished company. Goldsmith
and Reynolds are indifferent likenesses; and Johnson’s clothes fit
almost as accurately as Goldsmith’s.</p>


<p>123. <span class="smcap">Edwin Landseer</span>—<em>Rent-Day in the
Wilderness.</em>—“After the defeat of the Stuart army in 1715, at
Sheriff Muir, Colonel Donald Murchison, to whom the Earl of Seaforth
confided his confiscated estates in Ross-shire, defended them for
ten years, and regularly transmitted the rents to his attainted and
exiled chief.” The picture shows the rent being thus collected under
difficulties. A bearded clansman, attended by his daughter, is in the
act of paying; a friar kneels close beside Colonel Murchison; and a
number of other Highlanders have assembled for the occasion. This
large and crowded picture has a peculiar look, in consequence of the
stealthy and crouching action of most of the figures: they are keeping
close amid the brushwood on one side of Loch Affric, while some of
the Government soldiers are patrolling the opposite bank. The work
has thus—besides the generic merits which any large painting by Sir
Edwin Landseer is sure to possess—plenty that is both peculiar and
interesting, not unmingled with a certain impression of discomfort.</p>


<p>138. <span class="smcap">Herbert</span>—<em>The Valley of Moses in the Desert of
Sinai.</em>—This picture (as Mr. Herbert is stated never to have been
in the East) is somewhat noticeable in point of eclectic, and at
the same time diluted, study. The light and tone are agreeable, and
free from that hardness which besets many Eastern pictures; but, on
observing the comparative faintness of the shadows upon the blazing
sands, one sees at once that the avoidance of hardness has involved
some sacrifice of truth.</p>


<p>150. <span class="smcap">Ward</span>—<em>Royal Marriage, 1477.</em>—The detestable
humbug of a sham contemporary “MS.” is resorted to for the purpose
of informing the reader of the Academy catalogue that this painting
represents the marriage of the Duke of York,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>7</span> aged four, son of Edward
IV., to Lady Anne Mowbray, aged three. A bishop of almost decrepit
old age officiates, and Gloucester is naturally made a prominent
witness. Mr. Ward’s style of painting, chiaroscuro, and handling, is
universally known; it may be termed the overblown style, with about
as much retirement and repose as a peony the hour before it falls to
pieces. But this should not blind us to his solid merits of thought
and invention, always exercised in a direction which tells with the
public, and for the most part felicitously in other respects as well.
The present picture is an instance. Besides any amount of fine dresses
and demonstrative infancy, it boasts a power of association which must
take hold of every spectator: the infant bridal, the gorgeous dawn
of promise to the little sons of King Edward, and the crash of fate
reserved for them within the cerebral convolutions of the future King
Richard. We may afford, while we are about it, to recollect that this
effective subject pertains by right of priority to Mr. Houghton, who
designed it for a woodcut.</p>


<p>167. <span class="smcap">Frith</span>—<em>Sterne and the French Innkeeper’s
Daughter.</em>—The imperfectly Reverend Mr. Sterne is looking at the
damsel as she knits a stocking, and pondering upon its neat adjustment
to the shape of her leg. On general grounds much the same may be said
of this picture as of No. 87: both are superior examples of the easy
certainty with which Mr. Frith can strike the key he wants, just as
loud as he wishes it, and no louder. Sterne (as Goldsmith and Reynolds
before) appears to me anything but a good likeness: the young woman is
more French in feature than in the <em>ensemble</em> of the face.</p>


<p>172. <span class="smcap">T. Faed</span>—<em>Worn Out.</em>—This ranks with Mr. Faed’s
best pictures: it is very skilful, and has more equality of painting
than usual—somewhat less of obtruded knack and flourish. The various
small accessories are well related to the main incident of the
hard-working father who has fallen asleep while watching his invalid
boy.</p>


<p>188. <span class="smcap">Poole</span>—<em>Custaunce sent adrift by the Constable of
Alla, King of Northumberland.</em>—This moonlight picture has rather
the character of a manufacture; yet it is manufacture by a poetic eye
and pictorial hand. There is some clever handling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>8</span> in the water of
the foreground; and the entire absence of red from the picture—which
relies for colour upon iridescent tints of grey-blue, green, yellow,
and so on—is observable.</p>


<p>209. <span class="smcap">Houghton</span>—<em>H. Bassett, Esq., in his Laboratory.</em>—A
capital piece of peculiarity. Great pains and intelligence have gone
to the depicting of the scientific plethora of the laboratory; and the
sense of the shut-in, moderately-lit room, not lightly to be intruded
upon, is vivid. Mr. Bassett is represented smoking a pipe. This may
seem a trivial or purposeless incident. Yet it may have been introduced
to indicate some enforced pause in his work while an experiment is
maturing; and, if so, it is certainly not unsuggestive.</p>


<p>223. <span class="smcap">Orchardson</span>—<em>Mrs. Birket Foster.</em>—This seems to me
about the best work Mr. Orchardson has yet exhibited: it is a small
full-length—more a subject than a mere portrait. The artist has a
certain streaky or gauzy touch which amounts to mannerism: here the
handling and colour have almost a <i>soupçon</i> of Gainsborough. The
bright face, the quiet lighting of the dusky-boarded room, and the
untumbled white muslin dress, make up a picture in which elegant and
artist-like taste verges upon quaintness.</p>


<p>235. <span class="smcap">Elmore</span>—<em>Ishmael.</em>—An accomplished study, perhaps
(within its limits) unsurpassed by any work of its author.</p>


<p>236. <span class="smcap">G. D. Leslie</span>—<em>Home News.</em>—An English lady in her
remote Asiatic home is reading a letter from the old country. The
half-hovering smile, and the long-drawn regard of the eye as though she
were in contemplation back across the measureless ocean, are delicately
caught; also the coolness of the matted interior, jealously excluding
the sun itself, but not the sense of how it is blazing outside.</p>


<p>242. <span class="smcap">Millais</span>—<em>Stella.</em>—A single figure, three-quarter
length, and perhaps the very best Mr. Millais has done of its class.
The name Stella naturally suggests Swift’s Stella; and Swift’s Stella
holding a letter, with a countenance of subdued long-suffering,
suggests her receipt of the letter from Vanessa inquiring whether
she and Swift were in fact married. If this is the incident really
intended, the sympathizing spectator may be startled at being reminded
that Stella was at that time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>9</span> about forty years of age. But Mr. Millais
is not the man to mind much whether he does or does not represent a
particular incident, or whether or not any such representation is
endurably correct. He has painted delightfully a very loveable woman,
and that will probably suffice him and us. The tint of flesh in the arm
appears hardly so pure as the rest of the colouring.</p>


<p>247. <span class="smcap">O’Neil</span>—<em>Before Waterloo.</em>—This picture will
certainly have critics of two sorts. One set, incurious of artistic
subtleties, will batten upon such a purveying of British military
heroism, gushing young creatures, and harrowing family partings.
Another set will turn with æsthetic distaste from so much of
ball-costume and regimentals, and such a cross between the leaden and
the garish in colour. An intermediate set ought also to find a voice,
and to aver that the scheme of arrangement in the picture is very
ingenious, and successful in turning a serious difficulty—that the
story is told with great emphasis and much well-considered variety of
detail—and that, when one faces the picture with deliberation, one can
hardly refuse it the praise of being interesting. If Mr. O’Neil could
but get somebody else’s colour to exude through his brush, with texture
and surface to correspond!</p>


<p>248. <span class="smcap">Sir C. Lindsay</span>—<em>The Earl Somers.</em>—It is only fair
to cite this picture, by an amateur and a Baronet, as one of the best
portraits on the walls. The steadiness of the figure on his feet,
without compromise and without bravado, is alone a considerable merit.
A spectator may be struck by the great number of sitters who elect to
be painted in shooting costume, or in some other dress and with other
accessories of sport. “Manly exercises” will of course account for
most of this; and knickerbockers and black velvet have their share of
influence.</p>


<p>260. <span class="smcap">Legros</span>—<em>The Refectory.</em>—The eye finds repose and
satisfaction in this broadly and firmly painted picture, free from the
last suspicion of <em>ad captandum</em> appeal. Three monks and a tabby
cat have assembled to make a meal off a mackerel—the board laid with
a perfectly clean white cloth. The monks are all men of dignified and
thoughtful presence: two of them still pause over a book of orisons or
meditations before they begin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>10</span> the refection. It might not be unfair
to say that there is a good deal of space to let in the large-sized
canvas: but one need not exactly quarrel with that. The painter, a man
now of reputation equally confirmed and well deserved both in his own
country and in ours, knows perfectly well what he is about; we may
safely accept his point of view, and find in the result that, if he has
not done precisely what we might have bespoken, there is nevertheless
a definite value to be got out of his method of treatment, not to be
slighted because a different method would have given some other and
countervailing value. If anybody wishes to learn (among graver things)
what amount of executive short-hand suffices for making a cat tabby,
Mr. Legros’s picture will inform him.</p>


<p>268. <span class="smcap">R. Butler</span>—<em>The Lost Path.</em>—This artist’s name is
unfamiliar to me. His little picture of children astray in a copse
has great merit of naïve expression, rendered as well by action as by
countenance.</p>


<p>273. <span class="smcap">Storey</span>—<em>The Shy Pupil.</em>—The painter has here
attained to a high point of force in simplicity of work. The subject
is a budding girl learning to dance in her father’s presence. With
nothing that can be called elaboration, the execution would, for purity
of lighting and directness of hand, bear comparison with many a choice
Dutch picture. If we went to Mr. Legros for a tabby cat, we may consult
Mr. Storey for a small dog peering through a door; a few twirls of the
brush have, by a species of legerdemain, produced a surprising amount
of characteristic form. This work, with much effect of solidity, is
nevertheless amenable to my opening remarks as to sketchiness: but, in
so simple and semi-humorous a subject, that need hardly be objected to.</p>


<p>283. <span class="smcap">Dickinson</span>—<em>George Peabody, Esq.</em>—A very honest
good piece of work, and a most unmistakeable likeness, to be remembered
among the portraits of the year much to Mr. Dickinson’s credit.</p>


<p>288. <span class="smcap">Cope</span>—<em>The Disciples at Emmaus.</em>—Mr. Cope’s method
of art unites remarkable defining power with a certain thinness of
the primary material; it reminds one of good woodcarving—strong<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>11</span> and
accurate modelling bestowed upon a substance which, after the utmost
has been done for it, retains an aboriginal crudity. In the present
picture, the artist has planned out all forcibly and distinctly—he
has left nothing vague to his own mind or the spectator’s eye. Yet
no corresponding impression of reality is produced; the work wants
<em>imaginative</em> reality, and therefore its other elements of reality
do not tell as they were intended to do. To attenuate the form of the
risen Christ, and to make his drapery transparent to the evening light,
is not the way to remove him from the regions of fleshliness.</p>


<p>302. <span class="smcap">Horsley</span>—<em>Rent-day at Haddon Hall.</em>—Considerably
the best picture Mr. Horsley has exhibited of late, or perhaps at any
time. A very moderate proportion of adult good sense may have sufficed
to discriminate it from his staple commodity.</p>


<p>311. <span class="smcap">G. Richmond</span>—<em>Mrs. Brereton.</em>—While Mr. Richmond
can put into a face so much feminine candour and amiability as we see
in this likeness, no one need be surprised at his eminent standing
among portrait painters. To look at the face seems to be like making
Mrs. Brereton’s acquaintance—or like wishing to make it.</p>


<p>316. <span class="smcap">Calderon</span>—<em>The Young Lord Hamlet.</em>—Yorick is on
all-fours on the pleasance of the Danish palace, with little Hamlet
riding on his back; Queen Gertrude and some of her ladies looking on;
and an infant, presumably Ophelia, not yet “taking notice.” This is
strictly a sketch; no doubt a very able one, and only to be done by
a man of long training and solid acquirement in art. Not only is the
thing full of sparkling animal spirits as a whole, but each point,
when one attends to it, is pertinent and telling: except indeed the
face of the lady who holds Ophelia, and who exhibits a smile as hard
as her teeth. This is not the only time that Mr. Calderon has made
considerable play with teeth, and not, I think, successfully; nothing
is more difficult to manage in a picture.</p>


<p>323. <span class="smcap">Watts</span>—<em>The wife of Pygmalion, a Translation from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>12</span> the
Greek.</em>—This is one of the few works of poetic elevation in the
gallery: it is beautiful with a noble beauty, which one hardly knows
whether rather to call womanly or impassive. It rests midway between
coldness and warmth, without being lukewarm. It should be added that
the merit is not exclusively Mr. Watts’s, the head being truly “a
translation from the Greek,” <em>i.e.</em>, adapted from the fine antique
bust pointed out not long ago for admiration among the Arundel Marbles
in Oxford.</p>


<p>328. <span class="smcap">Leighton</span>—<em>Ariadne abandoned by Theseus. Ariadne
watches for his return; Artemis releases her by death.</em>—This also
is a picture which claims to be of the poetic order, and sustains the
claim; it may without rashness be pronounced the loftiest work Mr.
Leighton has produced, reckoning together subject-matter, scale, and
the result attained. To ignore the limitations of his style, or the
symptoms of them which this picture also presents, would be futile.
One might sum them up by saying that there is a certain hiatus between
his perception of the poetic in art, and his power of expressing it;
and that, though he bridges this over with a readiness of resource
which is to himself almost as natural as the first perception, yet to
others the artificiality of the bridge is glaringly and even irksomely
apparent. But the picture of Ariadne is sufficiently noble to keep
these considerations in the background, as soon as we have once for
all fairly stated or implied them. The face is wrung with sorrow,
yet is free from what we mean to condemn in a work of art when we
term it “painful.” One might say that this woman has died of the very
weariness of daily renewed grief. But the calm now is as profound as
the yearning heretofore; profound as the blue sea violet-tinted in its
distant intensity, or as the lulling oppression of its clang in the
sultry meridian, barely audible as a faint murmur at the dizzy height
of Ariadne’s rock-seat. There is a sensation of stationariness, as if
Phœbus Apollo might be pausing in heaven to see how his sister Artemis
has accomplished her mercy upon the outworn Ariadne. As I looked at the
picture, a divine reminiscence of Shelley intervened:—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>329. <span class="smcap">Mason</span>—<em>Evening Hymn.</em>—Again a very poetical
and beautiful picture, one of the enduring glories of the present
exhibition. It reaches higher than anything Mr. Mason had hitherto
done; and shows him qualified to paint figures on a fair scale of
size, and with an amount of positive beauty which, in his previous
productions (though well traceable), was to some extent overlaid by
the <em>picturesque</em>, as that is popularly understood. This work
glows with the light of a spring sunset, and with the unbidden fervour
of a group of young village-girls who are carolling the Evening Hymn
as they saunter homewards. It seems almost churlish to object to a
leading point of treatment in so delightful a picture; but I confess
to some suspicion that the men who are shown listening might with
advantage have been missed out of the subject altogether—and more
especially the youth who comes close behind a girl in white, holding a
rose in her hand. Mr. Mason is a painter who never loses sight of facts
in his pursuit of the beautiful; this is the one of his works which
goes nearest to merging all other its material in a general ideal of
loveliness and solemnity.</p>


<p>331. <span class="smcap">Pettie</span>—<em>Tussle with a Highland Smuggler.</em>—Here
we revert to the category of sketchy work; and we see in this picture
and in another by its author (No. 484, “<em>Weary with present cares
and memories sad</em>”), an unpleasant and unrepaying development of
style which might be described as “the offhand squalid.” No. 331 shows
extreme—indeed, excessive—cleverness: but its unsightly violence of
action embodies a subject of little consequence to any one, and of less
still to the cause of fine art.</p>


<p>347. <span class="smcap">Edwin Landseer</span>—“<em>Weel, sir, if the deer got the
ball,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>14</span> sure’s deeth Chevy will no leave him.</em>”—A masterpiece
of Landseerian art: the good hound Chevy is seen couched amid high
mountain ice and snows, by the side of a dead deer, which the ravens
have already scented from afar.</p>


<p>356. <span class="smcap">Millais</span>—<em>Pilgrims to St. Paul’s.</em>—A more rational
title would be “Greenwich Pensioners at the Tomb of Nelson.” One of
them has lost his left arm—a very resolute, bluff old seaman, whom
“foreigneers” may have been shy of tackling in his time; the other
halts upon two wooden legs, more senile and commonplace, but also, in
his undemonstrative way, one of those who, like his hero, “never saw
fear.” His face is most triumphantly painted; whether regarded as a
mere study of a head, or as a piece of character, or with reference to
its intense lighting by the flare of the sepulchral lantern. Indeed,
the picture is quite admirable throughout, and in power of painting
not to be surpassed by Mr. Millais, nor approached by any competitor.
There is in its materials something which verges towards a <em>tour de
force</em>; but all is so manly, and so free from sentimental overdoing,
that no charge arises against it on this ground.</p>


<p>363. <span class="smcap">Yeames</span>—<em>Lady Jane Grey in the Tower.</em>—An able
satisfactory picture; perhaps the best of its author. Lady Jane is in a
controversial colloquy with the Chaplain Feckenham: her face expresses
very successfully that she is weighing his arguments in her mind, and
considering what may be the true answer to them, but with no prospect
of her coming to the conclusion that answer there is none. Feckenham
also is appropriately conceived and painted, without any exaggeration.
Of costume and accessory there is enough, and not overmuch.</p>


<p>369. <span class="smcap">Houghton</span>—<em>In the Garden.</em>—A very handsome boy of
eight is lifting his little sister of five to smell a rose upon its
bush. A kitten which has already made some advances towards cat-hood is
romping around the stem. The feeling of the subject would be improved
were there more of a look of smelling in the girl’s face; and the
colour is hardly on a level with the other merits of the picture. It
is, however, a very choice and complete little work; fine in design
and draughtsmanship, and charming in general impression—quite free,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>15</span>
moreover, from that sort of nursery silliness which has infected
some canvasses of late, and has even been aptly enshrined in a title
reproducing the broken utterance of babes. Mr. Houghton knows that
“ta-ta” or “tootsicums,” whether written with the pen or rendered into
the language of the brush, is a mild effort of art.</p>


<p>401. <span class="smcap">G. D. Leslie</span>—<em>Kate Leslie.</em>—This artist is almost
always attractive, and often most engagingly so: the present work may
be cited in proof. But he is “painty” (as the profession terms it) in
the generality of his work, and especially in his flesh-tints. Here the
face has far too much of a tawny or ligneous hue; which is the more
to be regretted as the work, on the whole, comes nearer than usual to
ranking Mr. Leslie among colourists.</p>


<p>402. <span class="smcap">Poynter</span>—<em>The Catapult.</em>—Great knowledge, great
power of combination, and much disciplined artistic capacity, have gone
to the making of this picture. It has more effect, and is on the whole
more pictorial, than the very striking work which Mr. Poynter exhibited
last year—<em>Israel in Egypt.</em> Some people may refuse to take much
interest in a scene in which the work of the artificer or mechanician
plays so large a part; but, bating this objection (which to many will
be no objection at all), it is difficult to award anything but praise
to the picture. The event is the use of a catapult as an engine of war
in the siege of Carthage: we see written on one of the beams “Delenda
est Carthago, S.P.Q.R.” The officer is supervising, archers are
shooting; the monster hand of the catapult is about once more to launch
a red-hot bolt against the doomed city: pots of blazing pitch are
being hurled by the defenders at the assailants. The solidity and good
balance of all parts of the subject, the agreeable tone of colour in
flesh and otherwise, the sound drawing, unfaltering and unpretentious,
command high respect.</p>


<p>410. <span class="smcap">Wynfield</span>—<em>Oliver Cromwell’s First Appearance in the
Parliament.</em>—To find this picture uninteresting would be difficult.
Hampden is represented introducing his cousin to Cromwell; Pym,
Elliot, Sir Robert Phillips, Strafford, and many other famous men, are
present. The arrangement pleases<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>16</span> one from its obvious adaptation to
the more important demands of the subject, irrespectively of artistic
conventions. The method of the painting, however, is so excessively
opaque and heavy that, until Mr. Wynfield shall manage to correct this
blemish, one cannot expect his pictures to get cordially accepted by
the public, or to please critical eyes.</p>


<p>424. <span class="smcap">T. Graham</span>—<em>The Dominie.</em>—Mr. Graham has powers
of a high order; but he has seemed of late only too likely to be
led away by the offhand practice, semi-grotesque picturesqueness,
and rapid success, of some of his compatriots from beyond Tweed.
<em>The Dominie</em> is about the least laudable picture he has
exhibited—tending much to caricature, and to coarseness of handling.
Of course, along with this, there is a deal of ability; and the figure
of the boy still attests a genuine sense of beauty. Let us trust that
Mr. Graham will have “pulled up” by next year.</p>


<p>434. <span class="smcap">Hook</span>—<em>Are Chimney-sweepers Black?</em>—A most
delightful picture, fully equal to the best productions of its
distinguished author. There are two others in this gallery (Nos.
48 and 270) also excellent: but so little remains now-a-days to be
said about Mr. Hook’s works, except that they afford deep, pure,
and vivid pleasure, and show their painter to be one of the most
artist-like colourists and executants of the British school, that I
have passed them by, and limited myself to specifying the present one
only. A begrimed (not <em>over</em> begrimed) chimney-sweeper, with the
implements of his craft, presents himself to the startled eyes of a
naked infant, as fresh and bright as a Cupid, who has just been bathing
on the margin of the sea: he is still paddling in a sand-pool, and
takes refuge against his young mother’s dress, hardly so scared as
not to be a little amused. This group of the mother and child is most
charming; and all other parts of the picture are worthy of it.</p>

<p>439. <span class="smcap">Maclise</span>—<em>The Sleep of Duncan.</em>—The first aspect
of this work, as of so many of Mr. Maclise’s, gives an impression of
unreality, huddled, and oppressed with decorative exuberances. A more
deliberate inspection shows that it possesses, in ample measure, the
fine qualities which rank him so high in our school—qualities of
invention and design, associated with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>17</span> remarkable, though bounded and
monotonous, gifts of execution. The moment is when Lady Macbeth, having
drugged the guards, and “laid their daggers ready” (one of these lies
within the circlet of the crown), relinquishes any thought of herself
assassinating the old king, who “resembles her father as he sleeps.”
The tragic air of crime in Lady Macbeth, her superfluous stealthinesses
of action, are grandly given; though it cannot be said that her face
differs much from the type so constant and familiar in Mr. Maclise’s
productions. Duncan and the two guards are all three fine figures. The
lighting of the picture is not obvious: it would appear to be the union
of soft moonshine and pale diffused grey dawn-light which comes through
the loop-hole at the back; but this does not seem to account for all
the light in front, as on the figures of the guards; while neither
can one discern, on the other hand, that much (if any) influence of
artificial light has been intended by the painter. Real the picture
would, of course, never be made to look; but I think it would look
considerably less unreal at one point if Duncan’s head lay deeper in
the silken pillows.</p>


<p>440. <span class="smcap">Wells</span>—<em>Letters and News at the Loch-side.</em>—A
landscape with portraits and incident. I pick it out from among the
contributions of its able painter, for the sake of noting the great
amount of space, light, and air, which he has got into this picture,
although there is no single glimpse of sky: the ground rises all round
from the lake-side. This is no small thing to have managed.</p>


<p>449. <span class="smcap">Leighton</span>—<em>Acme and Septimius.</em>—Remarkable for its
elegant skill of concentrated composition. The knee of Acme’s left
leg—the foot of the same leg being set underneath her right thigh as
she sits—appears to me to project too much laterally. This may be a
convenient place for calling attention (with implied apology for not
speaking of them with the detail they properly claim) to Mr. Leighton’s
three remaining pictures: Nos. 227, <em>Jonathan’s Token to David</em>;
234, <em>Mrs. Frederick P. Cockerell</em>; 522, <em>Actæa, the Nymph of
the Shore.</em></p>


<p>453. <span class="smcap">Hodgson</span>—<em>Chinese Ladies looking at European
Curiosities.</em>—A quaint and amusing notion, and a pleasant picture.
A Chinese gentleman is exhibiting to his wives and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>18</span> women a
pair of European white satin slippers, which the small-footed fair
(or rather dusky) ones regard as elephantine eccentricities. An
Englishwoman looking at a Chinese “six-marker,” or at a Japanese
masterpiece of woodcut design or colouring, is not more tickled.
Perhaps the best head of all is that of the elderly woman to the
right. The peculiarities of Chinese physiognomy are not at all
overdone—indeed, I doubt whether the eyes are quite sidelong enough.
It would have been admissible to make one of the wives prettier, and
(if I am not mistaken) clearer-complexioned also.</p>


<p>461. <span class="smcap">Legros</span>—<em>Sir Thomas More showing some of Holbein’s
Pictures to Henry VIII.</em>—Without tampering with his own style,
Mr. Legros comes more than hitherto, in this picture, within the same
general lines as English art. The work, in essentials, is extremely
good; and simplicity of execution does not interfere with its keeping
its place well and solidly amid those which surround it. Sir Thomas
More does not strike me as much of a likeness. Henry is excellent:
he sits (if a bull may be excused) as he would sit in a contemporary
portrait, though not as he <em>does</em> sit in any of those I remember.
Perhaps his eyes are less small than in the likenesses. Holbein looks
the best man of the lot: well able to have done the fine things Sir
Thomas is displaying, and to do as many more as bluff Harry may
commission. Three ladies are also present. One of them gives her head a
turn in which the manner of a connoisseur is dimly anticipated; and one
might fancy her to be saying to herself, “Really, most excellent; but,
were I to sit to him, should I come good-looking enough?” Capitally as
the whole subject is kept together, I think a single little touch would
still improve it in this respect: one of the ladies might be glancing
from the picture to Holbein, and so helping to identify the work with
its worker.</p>


<p>477. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>—<em>In the Glen, Rathfarnham Park.</em>—This
is a halt of gipsies, who are lighting a fire; and perhaps there is
something more of incident implied than I happen to catch. Mr. Walker’s
pictures have a certain mottled look and grainy surface which might
be called mannerism, though not too confidently. At any rate, after
making some abatement for this,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>19</span> and for a too easily contented choice
of subject, one is fairly surprised at a sureness of hand which seems
to have at its finger-ends the power of realization without labour,
and at a sturdiness of work which yet picks up (as it were) at every
stroke refinements of drawing and colour. The evidences of ability are
so profuse that a non-practical critic like myself may well, in modesty
and self-knowledge, feel his mouth shut to objections. I should doubt
whether there are in Europe many artists more accomplished than Mr.
Walker, within his own sphere of work.</p>


<p>494. <span class="smcap">H. S. Marks</span>—<em>Experimental Gunnery in the Middle
Ages.</em>—Mr. Marks has done nothing better than this picture;
probably nothing equally good. The subject involves just the sort of
out-of-the-way humour which is his <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">specialité</em>; and he has made
this the informing spirit of a full composition without condescending
to any burlesque. There is much varied and capital by-play of incident
and expression; and the subject is so treated as to allow one, even in
these days of Armstrong guns and Chassepots, to feel a good-humoured
respect for the primitive artillerists.</p>


<p>499. <span class="smcap">Prinsep</span>—<em>A Venetian Lover.</em>—The gist of this
subject is made so evident that we could dispense with the motto—“De
deux amans, il y en a toujours un qui aime, et l’autre qui se laisse
aimer.” Handled with marked fulness and breadth, and with a very
painter-like choice of the <em>tints</em> of colour, the picture proves
once again that Mr. Prinsep is well qualified to work on a large scale;
having at command a fund of really pictorial material, on which he may
draw with full stress of faculty, secure that it will not fail him
at his need. As a matter of sentiment, the picture leaves a certain
feeling of discontent; the impassivity of the woman is so extreme as to
provoke one first with her and next with her impassioned adorer. But no
doubt this is only what the artist intended. In some parts the surface
may be considered too smooth—as especially in the lady’s face, which
has hardly the pulpiness of flesh. Possibly, however, this impression
would be corrected could one examine the picture closer.</p>


<p>510. <span class="smcap">A. Hughes</span>—“<em>Sigh no more, Ladies, Sigh no
more.</em>”—Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>20</span> Hughes’s pictures are always full of refined
sentiment; and this is eminently so, and in all respects one of his
best successes. The lady is so tender, uncomplaining, and beautiful,
that one takes her part on the instant. Happily, she seems, after an
interval of disconsolate dejection, to be dimly awaking once more to
the interests of life; and soon she will be taking the advice of the
song, and tempting fate with another affair of the heart. She is at
once sentimental to the romantic point, and domestically feminine. It
was a happy thought to introduce the thrush at her window, trilling a
cheerful ditty, which one can imagine that her heart translates into
the spoken language of the song. This picture has in it a gentle but
real poetry which places it on a very different footing from most of
the work in the exhibition.</p>


<p>511. <span class="smcap">Storey</span>—<em>Saying Grace.</em>—The small denizens of a
nursery have seated themselves with impeccable propriety for their
early dinner, regulated by (as one might infer from her physiognomy) a
foreign nursery-governess. The baby has joined his hands with dispread
fingers, and enacts (he is too young to pronounce) the grace with
a solemnity which would do credit to a parish-clerk. No doubt the
children are all portraits, with inordinate heads of hair; but the
baby’s irregularity of contour seems to exceed infantine bounds. Let us
trust that his mamma will insist upon his growing up with a modified
profile, and that “’tis his nature to.” The picture has a genuine
distinction of quaintness and zest.</p>


<p>513. <span class="smcap">Calderon</span>—<em>Œnone.</em>—Mr. Tennyson, with the magic
fetters of genius, has enslaved all Englishmen to the conviction
that Œnone can only be contemplated as in a state of heartbroken
dereliction; and I suppose that Mr. Calderon intends his nymph to be
so understood. I cannot, however, perceive that sentiment in her face
or action; she appears to the eye rather in a mood of rampant laziness
and florid self-display. This is a very singular piece of colour. White
or whiteish tints occupy a considerable space; the extremely blue
hills are the second important constituent; and the pea-green mantle
of Œnone is the third. The pea-green appears to me a discord, though
some other hue of green, along with a texture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>21</span> more like drapery, might
have proved much the reverse. On the whole, I should say that, in its
colour as in other respects, the painting has much boldness, with no
corresponding proportion of felicity.</p>


<p>517. <span class="smcap">R. Carrick</span>—<em>After the Sortie.</em>—This is a
very large picture, hung so high that one cannot fully estimate
it in detail. It represents a wounded knight borne up the winding
castle-stairs by three of his retainers; his wife, with a horrible
sinking of the heart, totters and clings about for support as she
follows. It seems to be a strongly designed and carefully executed
work, of very superior merit; the most important production of Mr.
Carrick, and about the best.</p>


<p>524. <span class="smcap">H. W. B. Davis</span>—<em>A Summer Forenoon.</em>—A landscape
and sheep-piece, warm, gentle, and genial. Landscape and the allied
forms of art occupy a very small space, comparatively, in the present
exhibition. There are nevertheless several works of this kind which
call for examination and praise: their being left unnoticed in this
pamphlet does not imply any indifference to their merits.</p>


<p>540. <span class="smcap">Miss M. E. Freer</span>—<em>Red Roses.</em>—Coquetry is the
predominant spirit of this work. But it is not painted with the
slightness which a coquettish picture from a fresh female hand might be
expected to display. On the contrary, there is a good deal of careful
realization, and an amount of general skill and force which places Miss
Freer high among lady artists. No. 446, <em>Margaret Wilson</em>, by the
same painter, hung too high to be scrutinized, seems to be equally
good, or better.</p>


<p>585. <span class="smcap">Maclise</span>—<em>Madeline after Prayer.</em>—The useful adage
which Mr. Maclise will never lay to heart is that “Enough is as good as
a feast.” We find Keats’s Madeline encumbered with items of furniture
and ornamentation. Moreover, the painter’s decorative taste is anything
but chastened; witness the horrible pattern which she has begun in her
broidery frame. A graver objection is the want of any real luminosity
in the moonlight which Keats has made so resplendent; the painted
window itself is the very maximum of opacity, and the light (if light
it can be called) seems to fall <em>upon</em> it, not to be transmitted
through its panes. Whatever his failings in execution,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>22</span> Mr. Maclise
can depict light vastly better than this when he chooses. So much for
objections. After any quantity of them, it remains that the picture is
highly attractive, and the Madeline a very beautiful creature—perhaps
the sweetest woman Mr. Maclise has painted. She is a personage
<em>not</em> made</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent1">“For human nature’s daily food,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noi">and yet she is sympathetic. To be that, she must be poetic
also.</p>


<p>589. <span class="smcap">Burchett</span>—<em>Measure for Measure.</em>—Mr. Burchett
follows up his remarkable work of last year with another of
corresponding importance. Matured consideration, and strong powers of
working and of development, have gone to the making of this picture;
which represents the great crisis in the action of <em>Measure for
Measure</em>, where the Duke of Vienna, disguised as a friar, is
revealed by the unwitting Lucio to the eyes of the abashed Angelo
and Escalus, and of the now almost hopeless Isabella and Mariana.
The story is told with much judgment and penetration (so far as such
a complicated story <em>can</em> be told) by the Duke’s vacated chair
of state, with coronet and sceptre laid upon it, between the seats
of Escalus and Angelo; the young courtier, facing the just uncowled
Duke, and recognising him on the instant, and raising his cap; the
frothy bluster of Lucio dying out on his scared visage as he gasps to
see whom he has been mauling and traducing; and other well-chosen and
well-combined incidents. The countenance of the Duke is German and
searching; that of Escalus true to the good-natured cynicism of the
substantially upright old man; Isabella has much of the nun about her.
Angelo is, I think, too much the burly insolent oppressor; for we must
understand from the drama that he really looked and was an abstinent
Pharisee, led on by temptation and opportunity into vilenesses quite
unlike the man that all others and himself supposed him to be. There is
much able and accurate painting in this work, though it would benefit
by more breadth of general harmonizing.</p>


<p>600. <span class="smcap">Parsons</span>—<em>The Wayfarer.</em>—A peculiar and delicate
piece of subdued execution, deserving of inspection; <em>so</em> peculiar
in its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>23</span> granulated texture that it hardly proclaims itself to be
oil-painting.</p>


<p>613. <span class="smcap">Hicks</span>—<em>Escape of the Countess of Morton to Paris,
with Henrietta, infant Daughter of Charles I.</em>—The most important
and best production of Mr. Hicks. Like Mr. Burchett’s picture, its
incidents require to be analysed one by one: when that process has been
gone through, one finds a great deal of ingenious skill standing to the
painter’s credit.</p>


<p>614. <span class="smcap">Prinsep</span>—<em>A Study of a Girl Reading.</em>—Mr. Prinsep
deserves real thanks for this painting. The girl is an exquisite
person, and the picture also may without flattery be called exquisite.
It has a most charming sense of the womanly in the maidenly. The fair
one is about to sit down to luncheon, but holds and reads her book
up to the moment of drawing in her chair. Perhaps she will violate
etiquette by persisting in “reading at meals:” and who will not forgive
her?</p>


<p>621. <span class="smcap">A. Moore</span>—<em>Azaleas.</em>—This will be remembered as one
of the <em>illustrations</em> (as the French phrase it) of the Exhibition
of 1868. It presents, in life size, a Grecian lady (or at any rate
Grecian-robed), at a pot of azaleas, some of which she plucks and drops
into a basin. Whether or not azaleas were known to Grecian ladies,
whether or not they came from America, are questions not difficult of
solution, but of sublime indifference to Mr. Moore. (The flowers in
Mr. Watts’s Grecian picture, No. 323, are also, I apprehend, azaleas.)
The study of the blossom-loaded plant is most delicate and lovely; and
the lady has elevated classic grace, though her face hardly sustains
comparison with the rest of the picture. For a sense of beauty in
disposition of form, and double-distilled refinement in colour, this
work may allow a wide margin to any competitors in the gallery, and
still be the winner. On the other hand, it is proper to remember that
such a painting as this presupposes certain <em>data</em> in art, which
<em>data</em> some people not wholly unworthy of a hearing demur to:
chiefly, it presupposes once for all that that innermost artistic
problem of how to reconcile realization with abstraction deserves to
be given up. How much could be said on this question from differing
points of view, I need not here indicate. You linger long to look
at Mr. Moore’s picture, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>24</span> return to it again and again: and that
justifies him in taking, individually, the benefit of one of those
points of view. He unites with singular subtlety of grace a phase of
the evanescent to a phase of the permanent: colour and handling which
withdraw themselves from the eye with a suggestion (or, as one might
say, with a whisper), to statuesque languor and repose of form.</p>


<p>624. <span class="smcap">Brett</span>—<em>Christmas Morning, 1866.</em>—In scale combined
with subject, this is far the most important picture Mr. Brett has
produced. We see a manned boat and a wrecking ship upon the immense
ocean, with its swirling drift blown across like a tongue of tormented
flame; and huge volumes of grey cloud over the horizon, walling out
from the sea the gorgeous dawn of a new day, on fire with the blaze of
sunlight. The painting of the vast sea-surface is a very great effort
of knowledge and mastery, and a very successful one.</p>


<p>629. <span class="smcap">A. Goodwin</span>—<em>The Dead Woodman.</em>—A picture of highly
remarkable effect, and poetic perception. A blue-grey bloom of sunset
broods luminously over all. The work has a kind of intellectual analogy
to the <em>Dead Stonebreaker</em> which Mr. Wallis painted years ago: but
in all points of externals it is entirely different.</p>


<p>632. <span class="smcap">Millais</span>—<em>Souvenir of Velasquez</em> (<em>Diploma-work
deposited in the Academy on his election as an Academician</em>).—It is
not for an outsider to surmise whether or not the Academicians court
the deposit of diploma-pictures which may have cost their painters,
working with the quick-handedness of a Millais, perhaps a couple of
days’ labour. However this may be, they have here got a diploma-picture
of that description, and an admirable one in its way it certainly is.
The resemblance to Velasquez is hardly such as to justify the title.</p>


<p>685. <span class="smcap">Watts</span>—<em>A. Panizzi, Esq.</em>—That this is about the
finest portrait of the year need scarcely be specified, Mr. Watts
being its author. It was presented to Mr. Panizzi by the Officers of
the British Museum, on his retirement; and happily expresses, in the
sitter, great powers of work, long in active exercise, and now in
well-earned repose. A sketch-plan of the Museum reading-room forms an
appropriate and not undecorative device in the right-hand upper corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>25</span></p>


<p>735. <span class="smcap">Sandys</span>—<em>Study of a Head.</em>—We have now got out of
the oil-pictures, and have come to the drawings. This is an excellent
study of a wilful, tameless-spirited beauty, who bites her hair in
her gathering mood. Further on (816) is an equally well-done head of
<em>George Critchett, Esq.</em>, a head that seems to teem with defined
calculation. It will be known to many besides myself that Mr. Sandys
sent to the Academy an oil-picture of Medea in an act of incantation,
not only worthy, but more than worthy, of his highly disciplined powers
and determined accomplishment. It has dropped out of the Exhibition
when the pictures came to be actually hung; leaving some food for
pondering to those who care for the higher and completer forms of
pictorial work. They may feel—and the feeling would be only enhanced
by some other things they may have heard, and a great deal of what
they see on the Academy walls—that an off-hand style of painting,
now predominant, has interests of its own clashing with those of some
graver phases of art; and that judicial equity in adjusting these
interests may sometimes be in default. Sir Francis Grant, detailing
after-dinner statistics, may fancy that the whole question is settled
by saying that there is space for so many pictures only, and that so
many more were sent in; but this is far from being the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dernier
mot</em>. Efficiency No. 1 and semi-efficiency No. 2 may be contending
for a residue of space, and the admission of either is obviously the
exclusion of the other; but he would be a very innocent President,
non-academician artist, or private and unprofessional person, who
should thence conclude that the Pompey and the Cæsar have coequal
claims, especially the Pompey. Anybody, who has experienced, written,
read, heard, or seen, even a little of this ever-recurrent hanging
controversy, loathes its very atmosphere, and gladly retreats from it,
seldom without a sense of protest, and a chafing at injustice.</p>


<p>753. <span class="smcap">J. F. Lewis</span>—<em>Bedouin Arabs.</em>—One of the very
finest studies of the kind produced by a hand unrivalled in its own way.</p>


<p>943. <span class="smcap">Munro</span>—<em>The Sisters.</em>—We are now in the Sculpture
Room. Mr. Munro has earned great popularity and a defined position by
works of this class, in which groups of children are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>26</span> treated with some
graceful incident and execution, and very genuinely graceful feeling.
The present group counts among the best of them.</p>


<p>948. <span class="smcap">Woolner</span>—<em>Elaine with the Shield of Sir
Launcelot.</em>—The maiden loves and muses, and pines as she muses;
but as yet her doom only hovers over her pityingly. The feeling of
reserve and purity, of the new experience of love timidly entertained,
and yet already permeating her whole life, and absorbing all her
forces into its own surging and resistless current, is predominant
in this figure. Along with this, and with much simplicity of pose
and motive, one readily perceives that the whole thing is uncommonly
treated—<em>uncommonly</em> rather than <em>unusually</em>. The face has
more of personal individuality, the turn of the figure more shades of
variety within unity, the execution throughout more distinction, than
British sculpture accustoms us to. So also with the hands and feet:
their peculiarities are all significant and forecast, though to my eye
they do not sufficiently partake of the beauty of delicacy. Compare—or
contrast would be the word—this statuette with</p>


<p>981. <span class="smcap">J. S. Westmacott</span>—<em>Elaine.</em></p>


<p>984. <span class="smcap">Armstead</span>—<em>Astronomy.</em>—A bronze colossal figure,
destined for the Prince-Consort memorial in Hyde Park. It has a
good decorative look, and adequate grandeur of pose and line. It
might fairly (so far as one can judge before it is placed <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
situ</em>) be termed a <em>proportional</em> work; one, that is, in which
the conception, treatment, and general force of impression, have
relation to its scale, and to its destination as one in a series of
impersonating figures.</p>


<p>987. <span class="smcap">Leifchild</span>—<em>The Dawn.</em>—The sentiment of this figure
is well expressed in two lines from the MS. quotation:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent1">“The Dawn, whose splendour is a promise still,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Heralding more than Day can e’er fulfil.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noi">It is the sentiment of an ushering-in, an announcement,
something to come. Mr. Leifchild has produced several sculptural works
eminent for thoughtfulness in concentration. The present figure belongs
to a different order of work, yet something of the same spirit can be
traced in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>27</span></p>


<p>1007. <span class="smcap">Woolner</span>—<em>Thomas Carlyle.</em>—The strong, emphatic,
penetrating style of Mr. Woolner, who searches under the surface of his
sitter’s face, and records on its surface what he has found beneath,
gave him the best of rights to deal with such a magnificent head as
Carlyle’s—marked as that is by a most powerful dominating expression,
with abundant points of subordinate detail and individuality. Mr.
Woolner had, indeed, done a medallion of the great writer many years
ago; now we get a bust worthily recording so memorable a man.</p>


<p>1027. <span class="smcap">Woolner</span>—<em>Reliefs from the Iliad</em> (<em>pedestal of
the Bust of the Right Honourable W. E. Gladstone</em>).—Here are three
subjects executed on a small scale, with a singular amount of original
force. The third, <em>Thetis consoling Achilles</em>, does not appear
to me, in composition and suggestion, so remarkable as the other two.
<em>Pallas and Achilles at the Trenches</em>, where the hero shouts to
the Greeks a superhuman cry, while Pallas overshadows him with her
ægis, is a most vigorous and admirable composition; indeed, but for
its small size, one would be minded to call it the finest thing Mr.
Woolner has yet exhibited. <em>Thetis praying to Zeus on behalf of
Achilles</em> is hardly second to it. The sea-goddess rises on tiptoe to
stroke the beard of the omnipotent cloud-compeller; and no single touch
perhaps could have given the amplitude and primitiveness of the Homeric
Pantheon more keenly than this. It is not exactly <em>naïveté</em>, and
still less exactly humour, but something happily between both.</p>


<p>1053. <span class="smcap">Watts</span>—<em>Clytie</em>; <em>Marble Bust,
unfinished.</em>—This is an experiment in sculpture by our
distinguished painter. I find it a very interesting one, and
(<em>pace</em> the professional sculptors) a remarkable success. The head
reverts over the right shoulder with a graceful and energetic turn; and
these qualities, especially that of energy, are preserved in all points
of view. The modelling of the bust and arms is pulpy and creased—more
comparable in tendency to that of the Elgin Marbles than of later Greek
sculpture. Indeed, I should surmise that the thoughts of Mr. Watts, as
he worked, were mostly shared between Phidias and Michael Angelo. The
spectator who finds some parts lumpy or rude should bear in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>28</span> mind that
the work is avowedly “unfinished”—even if he does not deem the general
conditions under which the experiment has been made sufficient to abate
the picking of holes.</p>

<hr class="divider3">

<p>Possibly some readers of this pamphlet may use it to be referred to as
they range through the Academy rooms, examining their contents. If this
is the case, I should regret to pass over without a word of mention
several works which, according to the scope and limitations of the
pamphlet, I have not found an opportunity of reviewing in any detail in
their proper order. After all, a great number of works against whose
skilfulness and merit I neither raise nor suggest any imputation will
be remaining totally unnamed. Meanwhile, a simple numerical list of
contributions may be added to which I would rather direct attention
thus barely than not at all. Some of them are productions of leading
importance: others have modest graces which should not pass unobserved.
The visitor must form his own opinion of whether and why they deserved
specification.</p>

<hr class="short">

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">I have</span> been asked to note down at random my impressions of some few
among this year’s pictures. These I am aware will have no weight or
value but that which a sincere and studious love of the art can give;
so much I claim for them, and so much only. To pass judgment or tender
counsel is beyond my aim or my desire.</p>

<p>Returning from the Academy I find two pictures impressed on my memory
more deeply and distinctly than the rest. First of these—first of
all, it seems to me, for depth and nobility of feeling and meaning—is
Mr. Watts’ “Wife of Pygmalion.” The soft severity of perfect beauty
might serve alike for woman or statue, flesh or marble; but the eyes
have opened already upon love, with a tender and grave wonder; her
curving ripples of hair seem just warm from the touch and the breath
of the goddess, moulded and quickened by lips and hands diviner than
her sculptor’s. So it seems a Greek painter must have painted women,
when Greece had mortal pictures fit to match her imperishable statues.
Her shapeliness and state, her sweet majesty and amorous chastity,
recall the supreme Venus of Melos. In this “translation” of a Greek
statue into an English picture, no less than in the bust of Clytie,
we see how in the hands of a great artist painting and sculpture may
become as sister arts indeed, yet without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>32</span> invasion or confusion; how,
without any forced alliance of form and colour, a picture may share
the gracious grandeur of a statue, a statue may catch something of the
subtle bloom of beauty proper to a picture.</p>

<p>The other picture of which I would speak, unlike enough to this in
sentiment or in tone, has in common with it the loftiest quality of
beauty pure and simple. Indeed, of all the few great or the many
good painters now at work among us, no one has so keen and clear a
sense of this absolute beauty as Mr. Albert Moore. His painting is to
artists what the verse of Théophile Gautier is to poets; the faultless
and secure expression of an exclusive worship of things formally
beautiful. That contents them; they leave to others the labours and
the joys of thought or passion. The outlines of their work are pure,
decisive, distinct; its colour is of the full sunlight. This picture
of “Azaleas” is as good a type as need be of their manner of work.
A woman delicately draped, but showing well the gentle mould of her
fine limbs through the thin soft raiment; pale small leaves and bright
white blossoms about her and above, a few rose-red petals fallen
on the pale marble and faint-coloured woven mat before her feet; a
strange and splendid vessel, inlaid with designs of Eastern colour;
another—clasped by one long slender hand and filled from it with
flowers—of soft white, touched here and there into blossom of blue:
this is enough. The melody of colour, the symphony of form is complete:
one more beautiful thing is achieved, one more delight is born into the
world; and its meaning is beauty; and its reason for being is to be.</p>

<p>We all owe so much to Mr. Leighton for the selection and intention of
his subjects—always noble or beautiful as these are, always worthy of
a great and grave art; a thing how inexpressibly laudable and admirable
in a time given over to the school of slashed breeches and the school
of blowsy babyhood!—we owe him, I say, so much for this that it seems
ungracious to say a word of his work except in the way of thanks and
praise. I find no true touch of Greek beauty in the watery Hellenism
of his Ariadne: she is a nobly moulded model of wax, such a figure
as a mediæval sorceress might set<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>33</span> to waste before a charmed fire
and burn out the life of the living woman. The “Actæa” has the charm
that a well-trained draughtsman can give to a naked fair figure; this
charm it has, and no other; it has also a painful trimness suggestive
of vapour-baths, of “strigil” and “rusma,” of the toilet labours of
a Juvenalian lady; not the fresh sweet strength of limbs native to
the sea, but the lower loveliness of limbs that have been steamed and
scraped. The picture of Acme and Septimius is excellently illustrative
of Mr. Theodore Martin’s verse; it is in no wise illustrative of
Catullus. I doubt if Love would have sneezed approval of these lovers
either to left or to right. As for detail, surely one arm at least of
his and one leg at least of hers are singular samples of drawing. In
his two other pictures Mr. Leighton has, I think, reached his highest
mark for this year. The majestic figure and noble head of Jonathan are
worthy of the warrior whose love was wonderful, passing the love of
woman; the features resolute, solicitous, heroic. The boy beside him is
worthy to stand so near; his action has all the grace of mere nature,
as he stoops slightly from the shoulder to sustain the heavy quiver.
The portrait of a lady hard by has a gracious and noble beauty, too
rare even among the abler of English workmen in this line.</p>

<p>The genius of Mr. Millais is of course a thing indestructible; but
all that can be done to deaden or distort it the Academy has done.
“They have scotched the snake, not killed it”—being as it is a
“Serpent-of-Eternity.” There is nothing here to recall the painter of
past years. There is no significance or depth, no subtlety of beauty;
there is the fit and equal ability of an able craftsman. The group of
three sisters is a sample of this excellent ability; no man needs to
be told that. There is no lack of graceful expressive composition;
there is no stint of ribbons and trimmings. There is a bitter want
of beauty, of sweetness, of the harmony which should hang about the
memories of men after seeing it as an odour or a cadence about their
senses: and this beauty, this sweetness, this harmony, all great and
all genuine pictures leave with us for an after-gust, not soon to pass
or perish.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>34</span> The picture called “Rosalind and Celia” gives us graver
and deeper offence. Of the landscape nothing evil shall be said, and
nothing good; but the figures cry aloud for remark and reprobation.
These women are none of Shakspeare’s. Think but in passing of the
fresh grace, the laughters as of April, the light delicate daring,
the tender and brilliant sweetness of the true “Ganymede;” what is
left of all this? She figures here as a fair-faced ballet-girl, with
a soul absorbed by the calf of her leg. And this dull, sickly, stolid
woman huddling heavily against her is Celia; this is the purest rarest
type that Shakspeare could give of heroic and sweet devotion; this is
she who alone even among his women could not live but in another’s
life. And Touchstone—can this sour ape-cheeked face be the face that
Jaques “met i’ the forest?” these the lips that rallied Corin and wooed
Aubrey? “Bear your body more seemly,” Touchstone. And with all this
debasement and distortion of Shakspeare’s figures, we do not even get
by way of amends a well-wrought piece of work; forget if you will the
names attached, this is still but an unlovely picture. It seems that
Mr. Millais has forgotten how to paint a lady; his women here all smack
of the side-scenes or the servants’ hall. Admirable for its strong sure
power of painting, the “Stella” is, nevertheless, pitiably vacuous.
If the sailors at Nelson’s tomb appeal somewhat overmuch to popular
sentiment of no deep or delicate kind, the picture is yet a noble one
and impressive. The faces are full of simple and keen feeling, of tacit
and loyal reverence. There is a superfluous ugliness in the two wooden
stumps; and perhaps the knack by which the light is arranged so as to
strike out severally from each pane of the glass lantern is too like
one of those petty feats which are as lime-twigs laid to catch the
eyes and tongues of the half-trained sightseers who jostle and saunter
through a gallery, pausing now and again to “wonder with a foolish face
of praise.” The worst of these pictures, painted by a meaner man, would
justly win notice and applause; but it is no small thing that a great
man should do no greater work than some of this. The clear eye and the
strong hand have not forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>35</span> their cunning; it is a master whom we
find too often at work fit only for a craftsman. Surely a painter who
has done things so noble will not always be content to take for his
battle-cry, “Philistia, be thou glad of me.”</p>

<p>I return now to the works of Mr. Watts. His little landscape is full
of that beauty which lives a dim brief life between sunset and dusk.
The faint flames and mobile colours of the sky, the dim warm woods, the
flight of doves about the dovecote, have all their part in the grave
charm of evening, are all given back to the eye with the grace and
strength of a master’s touch; the stacks that catch the glare and glow
of low sunlight seem crude and violent in their intense yellow colour
and hard angles of form: natural it may be, but a natural discord that
jars upon the eye. “The Meeting of Jacob and Esau,” though something
too academic, has in part the especial, the personal grandeur of Mr.
Watts’s larger manner of work. In the pale smooth worn face of Jacob
there is a shy sly shame which befits the supplanter: his well-nigh
passive action, as of one half reassured and half abashed, bares to
view the very heart and root of his nature; and the rough strenuous
figure of Esau, in its frank grandeur of brave sun-brown limbs, speaks
aloud on the other side of the story, by the fervid freedom of his
impetuous embrace. Far off, between the meeting figures, midmost of the
remote cavalcade, the fair clear face of a woman looks out, pale under
folds of white, patient and ill at ease; her one would take to be Leah.
It is noticeable that one year, not over rich in excellent work, should
give us two admirable pictures drawn from the Hebrew chronicles. What
they call scriptural art in England does not often bear such acceptable
fruit. I know not if even Mr. Watts has ever painted a nobler portrait
than this of Mr. Panizzi; it recalls the majestic strength and depth of
Morone’s work: there is the same dominant power of hand and keenness of
eye, the same breadth and subtlety of touch, the same noble reticence
of colour.</p>

<p>Before I pass on to speak of any other painter, I will here interpolate
what I have to say of Mr. Watts’s bust of Clytie. Not imitative, not
even assimilative of Michel Angelo’s manner,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>36</span> it yet by some vague
and ineffable quality brings to mind his work rather than any Greek
sculptor’s. There is the same intense and fiery sentiment, the same
grandeur of device, the same mystery of tragedy. The colour and the
passion of this work are the workman’s own. Never was a divine legend
translated into diviner likeness. Large, deep-bosomed, superb in arm
and shoulder, as should be the woman growing from flesh into flower
through a godlike agony, from fairness of body to fullness of flower,
large-leaved and broad of blossom, splendid and sad—yearning with
all the life of her lips and breasts after the receding light and the
removing love—this is the Clytie indeed whom sculptors and poets have
loved for her love of the Sun their God. The bitter sweetness of the
dividing lips, the mighty mould of the rising breasts, the splendour of
her sorrow is divine: divine the massive weight of carven curls bound
up behind, the heavy straying flakes of unfilleted hair below; divine
the clear cheeks and low full forehead, the strong round neck made for
the arms of a god only to clasp and bend down to their yoke. We seem to
see the lessening sunset that she sees, and fear too soon to watch that
stately beauty slowly suffer change and die into flower, that solid
sweetness of body sink into petal and leaf. Sculpture such as this has
actual colour enough without need to borrow of an alien art.</p>

<p>The work of M. Legros is always of such a solid and serious excellence
as to require no passing study. His picture of Henry VIII. and
courtiers is, I must think, an instance of absolute error; it has
no finer quality of its own, and the reminiscence of Holbein is not
fortunate. “The Refectory” makes large amends: he has never done more
perfect work than this. The cadence of colours is just and noble;
witness the red-leaved book open in one monk’s hand on the white cloth,
the clear green jug on the table, the dim green bronze of the pitcher
on the floor; beside it a splendid cat, its fur beautiful with warm
black bars on an exquisite ground of dull grey, its expectant eye and
mouth lifted without further or superfluous motion. The figures are
noble by mere force of truth; there is nothing of vulgar ugliness
or theatrical holiness. As good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>37</span> but not so great as the celebrated
“Ex-voto” of a past year, this picture is wholly worthy of a name
already famous.</p>

<p>The large work of Baron Leys stands out amid the overflow all round it
of bad and feeble attempts or pretences at work in all the strength
of its great quality of robust invention. It has the interest of
excellent narrative; in every face there is a story. A great picture
is something other than this; but this also is a great thing done. It
is a chapter of history written in colours; a study which may remind
us of Meinhold’s great romances, though the author of “Sidonia the
Sorceress” may stand higher as a writer than Leys as a painter. All the
realistic detail is here, but not the vital bloom and breath of action
which Meinhold had to give. Rigour of judicial accuracy might refuse to
this work the praise of a noble picture; for to that the final imprint
and seal of beauty is requisite; and this beauty, if a man’s hand be
but there to bestow it, may be wrought out of homely or heavenly faces,
out of rare things or common, out of Titian’s women or Rembrandt’s.
It is not the lack of prettiness which lowers the level of a picture.
Here for imagination we have but intellect, for charm of form we have
but force of thought. Too much also is matter of mere memory; thus
the clerk writing is but a bastard brother of Holbein’s Erasmus. Form
and colour are vigorous, if hard also and heavy; and when all is said
it must in the end be still accepted as a work of high and rare power
after its own kind, and that no common kind, nor unworthy of studious
admiration and grave thanksgiving.</p>

<p>It is well to compare this with the work that passes for historical in
many English eyes. Doubtless it may be said that such things as some of
these are not worth mention in a study so imperfect and discursive as
this must be; that they were better passed by in peace and left to find
their level. But it has been well said, “Il est des morts qu’il faut
qu’on tue;” and though undesirous in general to take that duty out of
abler hands, I will choose but one sample at random, on which I came by
chance, looking up from Sir E. Landseer’s dog and deer, a work of brute
ability, excellently repulsive as all brutish pain must be if duly
rendered.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>38</span> This select sample of historic art in England is a picture
of Mary Stuart about to sign her abdication. Posthumous parasites have
often libelled her with praise of pencil or of pen; but retribution
never yet fell heavier on her memory. She, the woman of such keen clear
wits, such indomitable nerves, such pitiless charms and such tameless
passions, that the very record of them can yet seduce and daunt men as
she daunted and seduced them of old—the fairest, subtlest, hardest
among women, with a heart of iron and fire—she shows here a fool’s
face, doubtful between a simper and a sob, raised in pitiable appeal
to a ring of stagestruck ruffians. The picture is worth notice as a
tangible piece of proof that certain men do really accept this as the
historic type of a figure so famous as hers. Another hand has drawn her
portrait, perhaps somewhat nearer life, to this effect; (I take leave
to cite the lines as a corrective, being reminded of them at sight of
this picture. They may perhaps find place here, as the Queen of Scots
figures thrice in this year’s show:)—</p>

</div>

<p>Having delivered my soul as to this matter, I return not unrelieved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>39</span>
from historic ground, with some hope that this aberration may prove
pardonable when the provocation has been taken into account.</p>

<p>I have compared Albert Moore to Théophile Gautier; I am tempted to
compare Mr. Leslie to Hégésippe Moreau. The low melodious notes of his
painting have the soft reserve of tone and still sweetness of touch
which belong to the idyllic poet of the Voulzie. Sometimes he almost
attains the gentle grace of the other’s best verse—though I hardly
remember a picture of his as exquisite for music and meaning as the
“Étrennes à la Fermière.” His work of this year has much of tender
beauty, especially the picture called “Home News;” his portraits have
always a pleasant and genuine quality of their own; and in the picture
called “The Empty Sleeve,” though trenching somewhat nearly on the
obvious and facile ground of family feeling and domestic exhibition,
there is enough of truth and grace visible to keep it up on the proper
level of art.</p>

<p>The “Evening Hymn” of Mr. Mason is in my mind the finest I have seen
of his works, admirable beyond all where all are admirable. A row of
girls, broken in rank here and there, stand and sing on a rough green
rise of broken ground; behind them is a wild spare copse, beyond it
a sunset of steady and sombre fire stains red with its sunken rays
the long low space of sky; above this broad band of heavy colour the
light is fitful and pale. The raised faces and opening mouths of the
singers are as graceful as those carved by Della Robbia or Donatello
in their choral groups; nothing visible of gape or strain, yet the
action of song is made sensible. Their fine features are not over fine;
they have all an air of the fields and the common country, which is
confirmed in the figures, cast in a somewhat ruder mould, of the two
young peasants who stand listening. One girl stands off a little from
the rest, conning the text with eyes set fast upon her open book; the
rest sing freely at large; the middle group of three girls is most
noble and exquisite. Rich at once and grave in the colour, stately and
sweet in the composition, this picture is a model of happy and majestic
temperance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>40</span></p>

<p>Mr. Walker’s picture of “Vagrants,” has more of actual beauty than
his “Bathers” of last year; more of brilliant skill and swift sharp
talent it can hardly have. The low marsh with its cold lights of grey
glittering waters here and there; the stunted brushwood, the late and
pale sky; the figures gathering about the kindling fire, sad and wild
and worn and untameable; the one stately shape of a girl standing
erect, her passionate beautiful face seen across the smoke of the scant
fuel; all these are wrought with such appearance of ease and security
and speed of touch, that the whole seems almost a feat of mere skill
rather than a grave sample of work; but in effect it is no such slight
thing.</p>

<p>In Mr. Armstrong’s “Daffodils” there is a still sobriety of beauty, a
quiet justice and a fine gravity of manner, far unlike the flash and
flare of obtrusive cleverness which vexes us so often in English work
of this kind. The sombre sweetness of a coming twilight is poured upon
hill and field; only the yellow flowers wreathed about the child’s
hat or held by the boy kneeling on the stile relieve the tender tone
of sunless daylight with soft and tempered colour. The action of the
figures has all the grace of simple truth and childlike nature.</p>

<p>“The Exiled Jacobite” of Mr. Lidderdale is full of the noble sadness of
the subject, excellent also as a genuine picture, a work of composed
harmony. The noble worn face of the old man, stamped with the sacred
seal of patience and pain, looks seaward over the discoloured stonework
of the low wall, beyond the dull grey roofs of a low-lying town that
slope to the foreign shore. His eyes are not upon the dusky down
sweeping up behind, the rough quaint houses and deep hollow, veiled all
and blue with the misty late air; they are set, sad and strong, upon
things they shall never see indeed again. From the whole figure the
spirit of the old song speaks:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse outdent">“Now all is done that man can do,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And all is done in vain.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noi">The pathos of the picture is masculine and plain as
truth;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>41</span> the painter might have written under it the simple first words
of the same most noble song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent1">“It was a’ for our rightful king.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Poynter’s picture of “The Catapult” has an admirable energy of
thought and handiwork; the force and weight of faculty shown in it
would be worthy remark if the result were less excellent. Excellent of
its kind it is, but not delightful; surprise and esteem it provokes,
but not the glad gratitude with which we should welcome all great work.
The labouring figures and the monstrous engine are worthy of wonder and
praise; but there is a want on the whole of beauty, a want in detail of
interest. The painter’s “Israel in Egypt” had more of both qualities,
though there is this year a visible growth of power; it left upon our
eyes a keen impression of gorgeous light and cruelty and splendour and
suffering; it had more room for the rival effects at once of fine art
and of casual sentiment.</p>

<p>The two pictures of Mr. Hughes show all his inevitable grace and tender
way of work; they are full of gentle colour and soft significance. The
smaller is to us the sweeter sample; but both are noticeable for their
clear soft purity and bright delicacy of thought and touch. In the
larger picture the bird singing on the sill, delicious as it would be
anywhere, has here a double charm.</p>

<p>There is a genuine force and a quaint beauty in Mr. Houghton’s
picture—portrait it can hardly be called—of a gentleman in his
laboratory. His other picture, of a boy lifting up a younger child
to smell a rose on the tree, while a kitten bounds at his feet, is
admirable for its plain direct grace of manner.</p>

<p>The head of a priest by Mr. Burgess has a clear air of truth and
strength; its Spanish manner recalls the style of Phillip, whom the
painter, it seems, has sought to emulate. Among the few portraits worth
a look or a word, is that of Mrs. Birket Foster by Mr. Orchardson;
though the showy simplicity be something of a knack, and the painting
of woodwork and drapery rather a trick of trade acquired than a test
of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>42</span> accomplished power, the work is so well done and the action so
plain and good as to bear and to reward a second look.</p>

<p>The show of this year is noticeably barren in landscape. Nothing is
here of Inchbold, nothing of Anthony. The time which can bring forth
but two such men should have also brought forth men capable to judge
them and to enjoy. Even here however the field is not all sterile:
there are two studies of sea by Mr. H. Moore, worthy to redeem the
whole waste of a year. One of these shows an ebbing tide before the
squall comes up; the soft low tumult of washing waves, not yet beaten
into storm and foam, but weltering and whitening under cloud and wind,
will soon gather power and passion; as yet there is some broken and
pallid sunlight flung over it by faint flashes, which serve but to show
the deepening trouble and quickening turmoil of reluctant waters. The
shifting and subtle colours of the surging sea and grey blowing sky are
beautiful and true. The study of storm subsiding as the waves beat up
inshore, though vigorous and faithful, is in parts somewhat heavy; but
the jostling breakers muster and fight and fall with all the grace and
force of nature.</p>

<p>In these stray notes I had meant to set down nothing in dispraise
of this picture or that, but merely to say of such as I found good
the best I had to say; passing by of necessity many well worthy of
praise or blame, and many more not wholly worthy of either. Of these
indeed the main part of an exhibition must usually be made up; of
mediocrities and ingenuities which art must on the whole ignore and
put aside without rebuke, though they may not call aloud for fire to
consume them. But a word may here be said of M. 
<ins id="Edouard" title="Original has Edouard">Édouard</ins>
Frère; a name that carries weight with it. He has been likened to
Wordsworth; it must be a Wordsworth shorn of his beams. In the large
field of the poet there are barren and weedy places enough; he may at
times, with relaxed hand and bedimmed eye, drop from the hills to the
quagmires, and croak there to children, instead of singing to men;
but the qualities which at such times a great poet may have in common
with a small painter are not the qualities which make him great. When
we find in M. Frère the majesty and music of thought, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>43</span> stately
strength and high-toned harmonies, the deep sure touch and keen-edged
pathos of the poet, then only we may grant the kinship. To the rags
and tatters, the stubble and sweepings of Wordsworth, he meantime is
more than welcome. What is there in this year’s picture well conceived,
well composed, well painted? what of effect, of harmony, of variety in
these crude monotonous figures? A great artist in verse or in colour
may assuredly make some great thing out of the commonest unwashed group
of dull faces; but the workman must first be great; and this workman,
without force of hand or delicacy, without depth or grace of painting,
would pass off on us, in lieu of these, such mere trickeries of coarse
and easy sentiment, fit only to “milk the maudlin” eyes of M. Prudhomme
and his wife. Turn from his work to that of M. Legros, and compare the
emasculate with the masculine side of French art.</p>

<p>Among the drawings here are two studies by Mr. Sandys, both worthy of
the high place held by the artist. One is a portrait full of force
and distinction, drawn as perhaps no other man among us can draw; the
other, a woman’s face, is one of his most solid and splendid designs;
a woman of rich, ripe, angry beauty, she draws one warm long lock of
curling hair through her full and moulded lips, biting it with bared
bright teeth, which add something of a tiger’s charm to the sleepy and
couching passion of her fair face. But of that which is not here I have
also something to say. Exclusion and suppression of certain things in
the range of art are not really possible to any academy upon earth, be
it pictorial or literary. It is natural for academies to try, when any
rare or new good thing comes before them in either kind; witness much
of academic history in England as in France; but the record of their
ill-will has always been the record of their impotence. Mr. Sandys’
picture of “Medea” is well enough known by this time, wherever there
is any serious knowledge of art, to claim here some word of comment,
not less seasonable than if it were now put forward to grace the great
show of the year. Like Coriolanus, the painter might say if he would
that it is his to banish the judges, his to reject the “common cry” of
academics. For this, beyond all doubt, is as yet his masterpiece.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>44</span> Pale
as from poison, with the blood drawn back from her very lips, agonized
in face and limbs with the labour and the fierce contention of old
love with new, of a daughter’s love with a bride’s, the fatal figure
of Medea pauses a little on the funereal verge of the wood of death,
in act to pour a blood-like liquid into the soft opal-coloured hollow
of a shell. The future is hard upon her, as a cup of bitter poison set
close to her mouth; the furies of Absyrtus, the furies of her children,
rise up against her from the unrisen years; her eyes are hungry and
helpless, full of a fierce and raging sorrow. Hard by her, henbane and
aconite and nightshade thrive and grow full of fruit and death; before
her fair feet the bright-eyed toads engender after their kind. Upon the
golden ground behind is wrought in allegoric decoration the likeness of
the ship Argo, with other emblems of the tragic things of her life. The
picture is grand alike for wealth of symbol and solemnity of beauty.</p>

<p>The present year has other pictures to be proud of, not submitted to
the loose and slippery judgment of an academy. Of one or two such I am
here permitted to make mention. The great picture which Mr. Whistler
has now in hand is not yet finished enough for any critical detail to
be possible; it shows already promise of a more majestic and excellent
beauty of form than his earlier studies, and of the old delicacy and
melody of ineffable colour. Of three slighter works lately painted,
I may set down a few rapid notes; but no task is harder than this
of translation from colour into speech, when the speech must be so
hoarse and feeble, when the colour is so subtle and sublime. Music or
verse might strike some string accordant in sound to such painting,
but a mere version such as this is as a psalm of Tate’s to a psalm of
David’s. In all of these the main strings touched are certain varying
chords of blue and white, not without interludes of the bright and
tender tones of floral purple or red. In two of the studies the keynote
is an effect of sea; in one, a sketch for the great picture, the soft
brilliant floor-work and wall-work of a garden balcony serve in its
stead to set forth the flowers and figures of flower-like women. In
a second, we have again a gathering of women in a balcony; from the
unseen flowerland<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>45</span> below tall almond-trees shoot up their topmost
crowns of tender blossom; beyond and far out to west and south the
warm and solemn sea spreads wide and soft without wrinkle of wind. The
dim grey floor-work in front, delicate as a summer cloud in colour,
is antiphonal to the bluer wealth of water beyond: and between these
the fair clusters of almond-blossom make divine division. Again the
symphony or (if you will) the antiphony is sustained by the fervid or
the fainter colours of the women’s raiment as they lean out one against
another, looking far oversea in that quiet depth of pleasure without
words when spirit and sense are filled full of beautiful things, till
it seems that at a mere breath the charmed vessels of pleasure would
break or overflow, the brimming chalices of the senses would spill
this wine of their delight. In the third of these studies the sea is
fresher, lightly kindling under a low clear wind; at the end of a pier
a boat is moored, and women in the delicate bright robes of eastern
fashion and colour so dear to the painter are about to enter it; one
is already midway the steps of the pier; she pauses, half unsure of
her balance, with an exquisite fluttered grace of action. Her comrades
above are also somewhat troubled, their robes lightly blown about by
the sea-wind, but not too much for light laughter and a quivering
pleasure. Between the dark wet stair-steps and piles of the pier the
sweet bright sea shows foamless here and blue. This study has more of
the delight of life than the others; which among three such may be most
beautiful I neither care to guess nor can. They all have the immediate
beauty, they all give the direct delight of natural things; they seem
to have grown as a flower grows, not in any forcing house of ingenious
and laborious cunning. This indeed is in my eyes a special quality of
Mr. Whistler’s genius; a freshness and fulness of the loveliest life
of things, with a high clear power upon them which seems to educe a
picture as the sun does a blossom or a fruit.</p>

<p>It is well known that the painter of whom I now propose to speak has
never suffered exclusion or acceptance at the hand of any academy. To
such acceptance or such rejection all other men of any note have been
and may be liable. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>46</span> not less well known that his work must always
hold its place as second in significance and value to no work done by
any English painter of his time. Among the many great works of Mr. D.
G. Rossetti, I know of none greater than his two latest. These are
types of sensual beauty and spiritual, the siren and the sibyl. The one
is a woman of the type of Adam’s first wife; she is a living Lilith,
with ample splendour of redundant hair;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent21">She excels</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">All women in the magic of her locks;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And when she winds them round a young man’s neck</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">She will not ever set him free again.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Clothed in soft white garments, she draws out through a comb the heavy
mass of hair like thick spun gold to fullest length; her head leans
back half sleepily, superb and satiate with its own beauty; the eyes
are languid, without love in them or hate; the sweet luxurious mouth
has the patience of pleasure fulfilled and complete, the warm repose of
passion sure of its delight. Outside, as seen in the glimmering mirror,
there is full summer; the deep and glowing leaves have drunk in the
whole strength of the sun. The sleepy splendour of the picture is a fit
raiment for the idea incarnate of faultless fleshly beauty and peril
of pleasure unavoidable. For this serene and sublime sorceress there
is no life but of the body; with spirit (if spirit there be) she can
dispense. Were it worth her while for any word to divide those terrible
tender lips, she too might say with the hero of the most perfect and
exquisite book of modern times—<em>Mademoiselle de Maupin</em>—“Je
trouve la terre aussi belle que le ciel, et je pense que la correction
de la forme est la vertu.” Of evil desire or evil impulse she has
nothing; and nothing of good. She is indifferent, equable, magnetic;
she charms and draws down the souls of men by pure force of absorption,
in no wise wilful or malignant; outside herself she cannot live, she
cannot even see: and because of this she attracts and subdues all men
at once in body and in spirit. Beyond the mirror she cares not to look,
and could not.</p>

    <div class="verse">Dal suo miraglio, e siede tutto ’l giorno.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So, rapt in no spiritual contemplation, she will sit to all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>47</span> time,
passive and perfect: the outer light of a sweet spring day flooding
and filling the massive gold of her hair. By the reflection in a deep
mirror of fervent foliage from without, the chief chord of stronger
colour is touched in this picture; next in brilliance and force of
relief is the heap of curling and tumbling hair on which the sunshine
strikes; the face and head of the siren are withdrawn from the full
stroke of the light.</p>

<p>After this faint essay at an exposition, the weighty and melodious
words in which the painter has recast his thought (words inscribed
on the frame of the picture) will be taken as full atonement for my
shortcomings; I fear only that the presumption and insufficience of the
commentator will now be but the more visible.</p>


<p class="center smcap">Lady Lilith.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent1">And her enchanted hair was the first gold.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And still she sits, young while the earth is old,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">And, subtly of herself contemplative,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Draws men to watch the bright net she can weave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Till heart and body and life are in its hold.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza2">
    <div class="verse indent1">Rose, foxglove, poppy, are her flowers: for where</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">And round his heart one strangling golden hair.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The other picture gives the type opposite to this; a head of serene and
spiritual beauty, severe and tender, with full and heavy hair falling
straight in grave sweet lines, not like Lilith’s exuberant of curl
and coil; with carven column of throat, solid and round and flawless
as living ivory; with still and sacred eyes and pure calm lips; an
imperial votaress truly, in maiden meditation: yet as true and tangible
a woman of mortal mould, as ripe and firm of flesh as her softer and
splendid sister. The mystic emblems behind her show her power upon
love and death to make them loyal servants to the law of her lofty and
solemn spirit. Here also the artist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>48</span> alone should first be heard; and
I, having leave to act as his outrider, give him the due precedence.</p>

<p class="center smcap">Sibylla Palmifera.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent1">Under the arch of life, where love and death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Terror and mystery, guard her shrine, I saw</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Beauty enthroned; and though her gaze struck awe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I drew it in as simply as my breath.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Hers are the eyes which, over and beneath,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">The sky and sea bend on thee,—which can draw,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">By sea or sky or woman, to one law,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The allotted bondman of her palm and wreath.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza2">

    <div class="verse indent3">Thy voice and hand shake still,—long known to thee</div>
    <div class="verse indent5">By flying hair and fluttering hem,—the beat</div>
    <div class="verse indent5">Following her daily of thy heart and feet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">How passionately and irretrievably,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">In what fond flight, how many ways and days!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noi">After these all weaker words must fall flat enough; but
something of further description may yet be allowed. Behind this figure
of the ideal and inaccessible beauty, an inlaid wall of alternate
alabaster and black marble bears inwrought on its upper part the rival
twin emblems of love and death; over the bare carven skull poppies
impend, and roses over the sweet head with bound blind eyes: in her
hand is the palm-branch, a sceptre of peace and of power. The cadence
of colour is splendid and simple, a double trinity of green and red,
the dim red robe, the deep red poppies, the soft red roses; and again
the green veil wound about with wild flowers, the green down of
poppy-leaves, the sharper green of rose-leaves.</p>

<p>An unfinished picture of Beatrice (the Beata Beatrix of the Vita
Nuova), a little before death, is perhaps the noblest of Mr. Rossetti’s
many studies after Dante. This work is wholly symbolic and ideal; a
strange bird flown earthward from heaven brings her in its beak a
full-blown poppy, the funereal flower of sleep. Her beautiful head
lies back, sad and sweet, with fast-shut eyes in a death-like trance
that is not death; over it the shadow of death seems to impend, making
sombre the splendour of her ample hair and tender faultless features.
Beyond her the city and the bridged river<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>49</span> are seen as from far, dim
and veiled with misty lights as though already “sitting alone, made
as a widow.” Love, one side, comes bearing in his hand a heart in
flames, having his eyes bent upon Dante’s; on the other side is Dante,
looking sadly across the way towards Love. In this picture the light is
subdued and soft, touching tenderly from behind the edges of Beatrice’s
hair and raiment; in the others there is a full fervour of daylight.
The great picture of Venus Verticordia has now been in great measure
recast; the head is of a diviner type of beauty; golden butterflies
hover about the halo of her hair, alight upon the apple or the arrow in
her hands; her face has the sweet supremacy of a beauty imperial and
immortal; her glorious bosom seems to exult and expand as the roses
on each side of it. The painting of leaf and fruit and flower in this
picture is beyond my praise or any man’s; but of one thing I will here
take note; the flash of green brilliance from the upper leaves of the
trellis against the sombre green of the trees behind. Once more it must
appear that the painter alone can translate into words as perfect in
music and colour the sense and spirit of his work.</p>

<p class="center smcap">Venus Verticordia.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent1">She hath it in her hand to give it thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Yet almost in her heart would hold it back;</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">Of that which in thy spirit they can see.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Haply, “Behold, he is at peace,” saith she:</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">“Alas! the apple for his lips—the dart</div>

  <div class="stanza2">

    <div class="verse indent1">And through her dark grove strike the light of Troy.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noi">Another work, as yet incomplete, is a study
of La Pia; she is seen looking forth from the ramparts of her lord’s
castle, over the fatal lands without; her pallid splendid face hangs
a little forward, wan and white against the mass of dark deep hair;
under her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>50</span> hands is a work of embroidery, hanging still on the frame
unfinished; just touched by the weak weary hands, it trails forward
across the lap of her pale green raiment, into the foreground of
the picture. In her eyes is a strange look of wonder and sorrow and
fatigue, without fear and without pain, as though she were even now
looking beyond earth into the soft and sad air of purgatory: she
presses the deadly marriage-ring into the flesh of her finger, so deep
that the soft skin is bloodless and blanched from the intense imprint
of it. Two other studies, as yet only sketched, give promise of no less
beauty; the subject of one was long since handled by the artist in a
slighter manner. It also is taken from the Vita Nuova; Dante in a dream
beholding Beatrice dead, tended by handmaidens, and Love, with bow and
dart in hand, in act to kiss her beautiful dead mouth. The other is
a design of Perseus showing to Andromeda the severed head of Medusa,
reflected in water; an old and well-worn subject, but renewed and
reinformed with life by the vital genius of the artist. In the Pompeian
picture we see the lovers at halt beside a stream, on their homeward
way; here we see them in their house, bending over the central cistern
or impluvium of the main court. The design is wonderful for grace and
force; the picture will assuredly be one of the painter’s greatest.</p>

<p>Wide and far apart as lie their provinces of work, their tones of
thought and emotion, the two illustrious artists of whom I have just
said a short and inadequate word have in common one supreme quality of
spirit and of work, coloured and moulded in each by his individual and
inborn force of nature; the love of beauty for the very beauty’s sake,
the faith and trust in it as in a god indeed. This gift of love and
faith, now rare enough, has been and should be ever the common apanage
of artists. <em>Rien n’est vrai que le beau</em>; this should be the
beginning and the ending of their belief, held in no small or narrow
sense, but in the largest and most liberal scope of meaning. Beauty
may be strange, quaint, terrible, may play with pain as with pleasure,
handle a horror till she leave it a delight; she forsakes not such
among her servants as Webster or as Goya. No good art is unbeautiful;
but much able and effective work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>51</span> may be, and is. Mere skill, mere
thought and trouble, mere feeling or dexterity, will never on earth
make a man painter or poet or artist in any kind. Hundreds of English
pictures just now have but these to boast of; and with these even
studious and able men are often now content; forgetful that art is no
more a matter of mere brain-work than of mere handicraft. The worship
of beauty, though beauty be itself transformed and incarnate in shapes
diverse without end, must be simple and absolute; hence only must the
believer expect profit or reward. Over every building made sacred to
art of any sort, upon the hearts of all who strive after it to serve
it, there should be written these words of the greatest master now
living among us:—</p>
